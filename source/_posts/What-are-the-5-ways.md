#  How can business owners keep their businesses safe?

Businesses face a number of risks, both big and small. There are steps business owners can take to help protect their businesses from harm.

One key step is to have a solid security plan in place. This should include measures such as password protection for computers and online accounts, security cameras, and alarm systems.

Another important step is to keep your business property insured. This will help protect you financially if something happens to your property.

In addition, it’s important to be aware of the risks that come with running a business. For example, you may need to take steps to protect your data from cyber attacks, or protect your employees from slips and falls.

By taking these precautions, you can help keep your business safe and secure.

#  What if businesses don't take precautions to keep themselves safe?

The subject of cybercrime is one that businesses, individuals and governments take very seriously. It can result in the theft of large amounts of money, the release of confidential information or even entire corporations going out of business. Despite this, a great many businesses do not take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from attack.

One reason for this may be a lack of understanding about the risks involved. Another may be a perception that the cost of protection is too high. Whatever the reason, the consequences can be disastrous.

In order to highlight the importance of protecting yourself from cybercrime, let's look at some recent examples:

1) In May 2017, WannaCry ransomware infected over 230,000 computers in 150 countries. The malware locked users out of their systems and demanded a ransom payment in order to regain access. This attack cost businesses and organisations millions of dollars in lost revenue and caused chaos worldwide.

2) In October 2016, 24 million records belonging to Yahoo were stolen by hackers. This included usernames, passwords, dates of birth and other personal information. The breach was particularly serious as it affected all Yahoo users - not just those who had accounts with the company.

3) In March 2016, hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank. They did this by gaining access to the bank's computer systems and manipulating its internal software so that money could be transferred into overseas accounts. This was one of the largest banking thefts in history and highlighted the vulnerability of financial institutions to cyberattack.

As these examples show, cybercrime can have serious consequences for businesses both large and small. It is therefore essential that companies take steps to protect themselves from such attacks. This can include installing antivirus software, using firewalls and employing password security measures.

Whilst these steps may seem costly initially, they are often much cheaper than dealing with the aftermath of a successful cyberattack. Furthermore, by taking such precautions you can help ensure that your business is less likely to become a victim in the first place.
